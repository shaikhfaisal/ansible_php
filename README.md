#### Development
This is a blank skeletal structure for quickly laying out a new role.

Two changes are necessary after copying this template role:

1. You will need to change the _devel/test.yml playbook to reflect the role 
   you are developing
2. You will need to rename the symlink in _devel to the name of the role you 
   are developing
